### Problem Statement
* https://www.kaggle.com/hanpengliu/my-first-machine-learning-model/

#### Alternate Problem
* https://www.dataquest.io/blog/machine-learning-tutorial/

### Architecture
We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.

* Load Data and Packages
* Analyzing the Test Variable (Sale Price)
* Multivariable Analysis
* Impute Missing Data and Clean Data
* Feature Transformation/Engineering
* Modeling and Predictions

### Tools
* Python 3.x
* Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows
* Jupyter
* Spyder - https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder
(SPyDER derives from "Scientific Python Development EnviRonment")
